SparkRing under Apache-2.0 at the revision recorded in `PROVENANCE.md`.
The additional hardening patch is a marked modification owned by Alex Ellis,
OpenFaaS Ltd, and distributed under this project's Apache-2.0 licence.

This repository contains no source from it and records conceptual credit only.

## Optional dual-PF source profile

The optional fourth patch and source-preparation integration are distributed
under Apache-2.0. The patch retains NVIDIA context and the attributed
SparkRing / OpenFaaS predecessor. See [dual-PF provenance](docs/dual-pf.md#attribution).
The historical source snapshot and rebuilt binaries have separate identities.
